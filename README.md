# nand2tetris
***
**My nand2tetris project.** 

<br/>From this 12 part course, I learned how to build a computer from scratch using only the nand logic gate. I learned how an object oriented Java-like language can be developed, and I have come to realize the incredible power of abstraction. 

<br/>I spent several months on this, and I had a lot of fun writing the assembler, VM translator, and tetris in the Jack programming langauge. I began regularly making commits around project 7. I actually skipped over Project 9 (the one where I code a game) and completed it last. My code can be found in the projects folder. In the earlier projects, they are in the hdl files. All of the Java files in the later projects (part 6+) were written by me, and the Jack files in projects 9 and 12 were written by me.
