# nand2tetris
***
**My nand2tetris project.** I spent *several* months on this, and I had a lot of fun writing the assembler, VM translator, and tetris in the Jack programming langauge. I began regularly making commits around project 7. I actually skipped over Project 9 (the one where I code a game) and completed it last.
