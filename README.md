# nand2tetris

From this 12 part course, I learned how to build a computer from scratch using only the nand logic gate. I learned how an object oriented Java-like language can be developed, and I have come to realize the incredible power of abstraction. 

## Installation

This installation is meant to demonstrate my work in project 9, where I coded a game in Jack. After forking the repository, clone it to your local computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

## Usage

```bash
./tools/VMEmulator.bat    # for Windows
sh tools/VMEmulator.sh    # for Mac OS
./tools/VMEmulator.sh     # for Unix
```
Click the folder icon in the top left, select the nand2tetris/projects/09/Tetris folder. Click yes, drag the slider to fast, and change "animate" from program flow to no animation. CLick the double arrow button, and enjoy Tetris!

## Notes
- I spent several months on this, and I had a lot of fun writing the assembler, VM translator, and tetris in the Jack programming langauge. 
- I began regularly making commits around project 7. I actually skipped over Project 9 (the one where I code a game) and completed it last. 
- My code can be found in the projects folder. In the earlier projects, they are in the hdl files. All of the Java files in the later projects (part 6+) and the Jack files in projects 9 and 12 were written by me.
