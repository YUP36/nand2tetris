# nand2tetris
***
**My nand2tetris project.** From this 12 part course, I learned how to build a computer from scratch using only the nand logic gate. I learned how an object oriented Java-like language can be developed, and I have come to realize the incredible power of abstraction. I spent several months on this, and I had a lot of fun writing the assembler, VM translator, and tetris in the Jack programming langauge. I began regularly making commits around project 7. I actually skipped over Project 9 (the one where I code a game) and completed it last.
